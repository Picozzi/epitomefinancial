# epitomefinancial

Epitome Financial is a django web application designed to help better track all of your personal investments. It lists all of your investmnts in one place and provides various analytics to review.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to learn how to use the django framework. Therefore, some of the code has not been fully optimized. Future iterations of this project will attempt to combine react and django to create a "django api."
